## About Me

I am a second-year M.S. student in the [Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhijin Qin](https://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/qinzhijin/zh_CN/index.htm), and I am majoring in Artificial Intelligence and Communication Engineering. Prior to this, I have completed my bachelor’s degree in the [School of Electronic and Information Engineering at Beijing Jiaotong University](https://eie.bjtu.edu.cn/) in 2024.

My current research focuses on feed-forward 4D reconstruction, compression and transmission for point clouds. **My primary research objectives are to decouple the geometry and semantics for 4D representations, and to explore intelligence for joint spatial-temporal continuous perception keeping me passionate.** I would be sincerely delighted to exchange ideas and seek collaboration opportunities with researchers and peers!

## Research Interests

- **3D Computer Vision:** 4D Reconstruction, Spatial Intelligence, 3D Representation Learning
- **Immersive Communication:** Holographic Communications, Semantic Communications, AI-enabled Communications
- **Video Coding:** Compression and Transmission for 4D Point Cloud videos
